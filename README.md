This project uses Naive Bayes classifier to compute the probability of "interesting" and "not interesting" of recent updated news. You can use the built-in browser to read the news. When you hit "Like", "No Like" and "Read", the words shown in "Like" and "No Like" and the total number of read news will be recorded.

You don't need training data to train the classifier. It will become more and more accurate as you use.

To start this desktop application, just run "main.py". It requires PySide6.2. This project uses PySide6.2 and QtQuick6.2 (QML) to develop. If any of the QML code logic looks not straight forward to you, it could be the alternative way due to a lot of bugs of QtQuick.

You can modify the code to fit any website. Don't waste your time on any news that you are not interested in.
